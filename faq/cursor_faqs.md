Cursor includes built in AI functionality.  

This functionality is accessed in several ways.  

When you have a file open in Cursor, you can press one of several different key combinations to access different functionality.  

These are:

01.  `Ctrl` + `K` for in-file code generation 
02.  `Ctrl` + `L` to open up an AI chat panel in the sidebar
03.  `Ctrl` + `I` to create and edit code across multiple files

You can select three different ‘modes’ in `Ctrl` + `L`:

- Normal
- Interpreter
- Long Context Chat

Interpreter Mode generates executable Python code that can be run on your local file system. 

Long Context Chat lets you select from one of the available long chat LLMs.  

You can also press `Ctrl` + `K` in the Terminal within Cursor to generate terminal commands from natural language prompts.
