An unofficial collection of resources created by a fan of [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) - the AI first code editor :heart: :raised_hands: .

The resources cover FAQs, features and approaches to get the most out of Cursor.    

This is a hobby project so some resources may become out of date.

But hopefully they still give you a general idea of what's possible in Cursor!

**Cursor FAQs**

What is Cursor? Who made it? What are its main features?   

See [cursor_faqs.md](cursor_faqs/cursor_faqs.md) for a list of FAQs.  

-----

**Comprehensive and Succinct List of Cursor Features**  

A GitHub Pages site with the rather ambitious task of listing all of Cursor's features (work in progress).

**Canned Prompts**  

This is an approach to saving time when writing prompts in Cursor. 

Similar to the use of 'canned responses' in helpdesk software (eg from a quick internet search):

[https://www.helpdesk.com/help/what-are-canned-responses](https://www.helpdesk.com/help/what-are-canned-responses)

[https://www.livechat.com/help/set-canned-responses](https://www.livechat.com/help/set-canned-responses)

[https://www.customerly.io/canned-response-templates](https://www.customerly.io/canned-response-templates)

See [canned_prompts.md](canned_prompts/canned_prompts.md) for a list of example canned prompts. 

Just use the `@` [Files symbol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files) to select the canned prompts file and then reference the relevant prompt.
