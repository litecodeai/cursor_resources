An unofficial collection of resources created by a fan of [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) - the AI first code editor :heart: :raised_hands: .

The resources cover FAQs, features and approaches to get the most out of Cursor.    

This is a hobby project so some resources may become out of date.

But hopefully they still give you a general idea of what's possible in Cursor!

**Comprehensive and Succinct List of Cursor Features**  

A GitHub Pages site with the rather ambitious task of listing all of Cursor's features (work in progress).

**Canned Prompts**  

Similar to the use of 'canned messages' in helpdesk software, this is an approach to saving time when writing prompts. 

`canned_prompts.md` contains some example canned prompts.
