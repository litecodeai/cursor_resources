In `Cursor Settings` on the `General` tab, next to `Account`, does it say `Pro`?

Are you signed in with the same account that you purchased the `Pro` subscription with?

What happens if you sign out, restart Cursor and sign in again?

For further troubleshooting, you might want to share:

System Information from:

`Cursor` > `Help` > `About`

Any errors visible via:

`Cursor` > `Help` > `Toggle Developer Tools`
(and then click on the `Console` tab)
