**`01)`**   Screenshot of issue (redact any sensitive information)  

**`02)`**   Steps to reproduce 

**`03)`**  System Information from:  

`Cursor` > `Help` > `About`

**`05)`**  Developer tools console errors 

Open developer tools via:

`Cursor` > `Help` > `Toggle Developer Tools`

and then click `Console` and see if there are any related errors.

**`06)`**  Logs

On Windows, you can find logs here:  

```txt
C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\logs
```

This is the parent folder of the folder that is opened when doing:

 - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (to open command palette in Cursor) 
 
 - Typing and selecting `Developer: Open Logs Folder` 
 
You can also view logs in `Cursor` > `Terminal` > `Output` and then click on the dropdown and select `Window` or one of the other Cursor specific options, such as  `Cursor Tab` or `Cursor Indexing & Retrieval`.
