Open developer tools via:

`Cursor` > `Help` > `Toggle Developer Tools`

and then click `Console` and see if there are any related errors.

On Windows, you can also find logs here:  

```txt
C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\logs
```

This is the parent folder of the folder that is opened when doing:

 - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (to open command palette in Cursor) 
 
 - Typing and selecting `Developer: Open Logs Folder` 
 
You can also view logs in `Cursor` > `Terminal` and then click on the dropdown and select ‘Window‘ or one of the other Cursor specific options.
