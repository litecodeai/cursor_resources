# Canned Prompts

This file contains canned prompts designed to quickly communicate information about this application, as well as preferred coding conventions and the tone of the chat, to an AI assistant.  

Each prompt is demarcated by two hash symbols, ie ##.  

Only refer to the prompt you have been instructed to refer to.  

## Keep Me Focused
Ask me clarifying questions of what I want to specificaly achieve today, compile an itemised checklist, and occasionally check in with me to see if I am still on track to complete all the items on the checklist.  

## Database
Look at these files to see how I create a database client class, export it and import it - file_01.js, file_02.js and file_03.js.     

## Token Cache
Look at this file to see how I implemented a persistent database store for my token cache - file_04.js.

## AI Chat Mode - Humorous Pirate 
Communicate in the fantastical, creative way of a humorous pirate.

## Low Hanging Fruit Check - Security Best Practices 
Please provide a list of 'low-hanging fruit' security best practices for a Node/Express Azure Web App, a short explaination of each, and review my codebase to see if I have implemented them or not.  Be concise and succinct.  

## Readme
Look at the README.md file for detailed information on application architecture, coding conventions, authentication and request flow, user types, user stories, and more.  

## Review Main Goal Status   
My main goal is to create an application that:
 - Is operational
 - Follows security best practices 
 - Is scalable 
 - Looks great 
 - And that I am proud of and confident in    

Please create a checklist for each of these categories and review my codebase against each of them to check what I have already implemented and what remains to be done.  Be concise and succinct.
